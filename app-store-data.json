Build your dream ride with an unbelievable range of cars and customizations. Launch yourself between chaos and control as you hit the loud pedal and roll into underground car culture. Win races, up your rep, then kick into more races, more customizations, and more cars. Make your choices and never look back. Tonight we ride!\n\nThis app offers in app purchases. You may disable in app purchases using your device settings.\n\nCUSTOMIZE EXTREME RIDES\nPick up the real-world cars you’ve always wanted, from the Subaru BRZ to the BMW M4, McLaren 650s, Porsche 911, and more. Then trick them out with the hottest customization system on mobile, from spots like the Mod Shop and the Black Market, giving you over 2.5 million custom combos to play with. Your rides are waiting – take them to the stages or streets to go head-to-head versus the competition and prove yourself.  \n\nDRIVE FAST – AND FEARLESS \nSteer onto the streets of Blackridge, driving reckless and juiced as sparks fly. Accelerate over jumps and around debris, into traffic, against walls, and through high-speed Nitro Zones. Flip on the nitrous and thrust yourself into another level of adrenaline-fueled driving and drifting. Around every corner is a fresh race as you clash with local crews and local cops. It’s a world full of wannabe drivers – can you stay in front and earn respect? \n\nRACE TO WIN\nNever back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep. Dig, drift, drag, and roll your ride to wins with police on your tail, hitting each inch of the map hard by the time you reach the big end. Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races – and that’s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world’s best cars. Because one ride is never enough!\n\n---------------------\nTerms of Service : http://www.ea.com/terms-of-service\nGame EULA: http://tos.ea.com/legalapp/mobileeula/US/en/GM/\nVisit https://help.ea.com/ for assistance or inquiries. \n\nEA may retire online features and services after 30 days’ notice posted on www.ea.com/1/service-updates\n\nImportant Consumer Information: \nThis app: requires a persistent Internet connection (network fees may apply); requires acceptance of EA’s Privacy & Cookie Policy, TOS and EULA includes in-game advertising; collects data through third party analytics technology (see Privacy & Cookie Policy for details); contains direct links to the Internet and social networking sites intended for an audience over 13.","genreIds":["6014","7015","7013"],"releaseDate":"2015-10-01T01:40:08Z","sellerName":"EA Swiss Sarl","bundleId":"com.ea.nfs2014.bv","releaseNotes":"Hello street racers!

Think you’re craving this legendary drink now?  Just wait until you build the ultimate, irresistible combination of flavors in ICEE MAKER!  Your taste buds will take you to the nearest ICEE machine! \n  \nLet the fun begin by choosing your cup and lid or create your very own cup design!  Next, choose from 20 different ICEE flavors, or create and name your very own flavor.  Show off your skills and become an official ICEE mixologist!  \n\nWhen it’s time to clean the machine, don’t worry, it’s much more fun than real life cleaning!  Once you’ve made that machine sparkle like new, personalize your cool creation with ICEE bear decals and other fun ICEE stickers.  And who could forget the straw?  Dig in and choose one of many swirly, curly, twirly straws.  You can even add colored stripes and logos to your straw!  \n  \nNow that your drink is just the way you like it, slurp it down and enjoy it to the last drop, share it on Facebook, email it to a friend, or save it in the freezer to enjoy later!  Maybe you’re up for an ICEE challenge?  See how many ICEEs you can drink in 30 seconds, but be sure to pace yourself… if you drink too fast, you will get a brain freeze!   After all, ICEEs were made to be perfect, not painful!   You won’t need snow cones, popsicles, ice pops or frozen yogurt when you can enjoy the absolute coolest treat around with ICEE MAKER!\n\nThanks for making us the #1 APP on the ENTIRE app store!  We appreciate all of our loyal fans and customers! \n\nAbout Us \nICEE Maker is brought to you by Sunstorm Games, the inventors of the Sunnyville series and the MAKER series of games, Fair Food Maker, Dessert Maker, and Candy Maker to name just a few.\nICEE Maker is free to play but in-app purchases are available in the game. \n\nProtecting privacy is especially important to us at Sunstorm Games.

When the red indicator light turns off, your cupcakes are fully baked and ready for your decorating skills!  \n  \nNext, select the color and style of icing for each cupcake.

During the \"bad update\" period I tried out two other highly rated paid apps. While they indeed have the same goal and mostly found the same words and point values, this app had by far the best user interface. The others felt clunky and half finished. They took longer to scan and were not as intuitive to use. \nI didn't enjoy using them as much and eventually quite using a cheat app altogether. If you need and or want a good \"helper\" tool for \"Words With Friends\", you can't go wrong with this app. Even if you only use the free, truly ad-free one and decide not to pay for the highest scoring words.\n============================================\n\n\nThe creators of this app are in no way affiliated with the authors of Words with Friends, or any other app, game, licensor or trademark mentioned in this description or in the app.","genreIds":["6016","6014","7019"],"releaseDate":"2011-05-12T01:18:45Z","sellerName":"RedSpell","bundleId":"com.redspell.wwfc","releaseNotes":"* Words with friends fast mode supported\n* Fixed bugs in OCR engine","trackId":432306789,"trackName":"Words with free EZ Cheats – auto cheat with OCR for Words With Friends game (HD version supported)","primaryGenreName":"Entertainment","primaryGenreId":6016,"isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"formattedPrice":"Free","minimumOsVersion":"6.0","averageUserRating":4.5,"userRatingCount":121447},{"screenshotUrls":["http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/4d/5d/79/4d5d79f2-543e-e3c4-ef16-a49b6a729c3d/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/58/98/6f/58986f8c-dfcf-55bb-18e0-c2027ff148e2/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/bb/12/53/bb125367-c377-04e8-98a1-63be735cb4ec/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/f0/ec/51/f0ec5156-dc9a-2e94-9bb6-16fad16adbae/screen1136x1136.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/08/52/e0/0852e031-853e-97f3-84d2-4ba8da49af3c/screen1136x1136.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshotUrls":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/20/86/ee/2086eee7-f064-1289-f00e-3bb89ad47be0/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/85/f2/59/85f2599c-96ae-d383-152e-b4d8b5f97e67/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/99/91/25/999125fd-87f5-86da-4bba-6838a2875645/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/a5/2a/67/a52a6787-c83c-6d8a-e32f-214a19f05db7/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple7/v4/a5/f6/2a/a5f62a9f-67f2-8527-6513-126c92e338d1/screen480x480.jpeg"],"artworkUrl60":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple2/v4/c4/7f/99/c47f990c-fa7a-76c4-20ba-f334143fa156/AppIcon57x57.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","artworkUrl512":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/2b/42/a4/2b42a40c-1bcd-9684-e4a3-094afb181620/mzl.ahbllxua.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","artistViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/turbo-chilli-pty-ltd/id574324031?uo=4","kind":"software","features":["iosUniversal"],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPadWifi","iPad3G","iPodTouchThirdGen","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"],"advisories":[],"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"trackCensoredName":"Unroll Me - unblock the slots","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":166,"languageCodesISO2A":["EN"],"fileSizeBytes":"47829734","contentAdvisoryRating":"4+","artworkUrl100":"http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple4/v4/2b/42/a4/2b42a40c-1bcd-9684-e4a3-094afb181620/mzl.ahbllxua.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5,"trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unroll-me-unblock-the-slots/id769574372?mt=8&uo=4","trackContentRating":"4+","currency":"USD","wrapperType":"software","version":"1.4.6","artistId":574324031,"artistName":"Turbo Chilli Pty Ltd","genres":["Games","Board","Family"],"price":0,"description":"Guide the white ball to the red GOAL block by moving the slots.

Pop the Lock rose to the number one free app on the entire store. Over 4 million players!! That's unreal, and our small little team wants to tell you all just how much we feel the love!\n\nNow, are you ready to feel the love?!\n\nWe read ALL of your reviews and we worked our tails off to bring you an update that would make you smile!\n\n\n100 New Levels:\nLULzTEFFA said, \"I am a big fan of this game [already] at 90 locks and it's getting harder and longer. I recommend you play this game sober.\"\n\nSounds like you're almost out of levels. That just won't do. Good news for you! We've added 100 more for a total of 209 levels, and yes, they are harder and longer too. Also, about your recommendation to play Pop the Lock sober. Sure, why not. We'll try anything once.\n\n\nHappiness:\nJosh Rath said, \"It's been a long time since a game has made me happy, yet challenged without the need to throw my iPhone into a wall after 10 minutes.\"\n\nYou have a strange definition of happiness Josh. But hey, we don't judge, we're just happy we're keeping that iPhone away from the wall.\n\n\nSettings Menu/Remove Ads:\nAngelfreak91 said, \"Put in an option to pay for Ad removal?\"\n\nPlaying Pop the Lock without the ads is how we initially designed the game. It's simple, gorgeous, and best of all, you can focus on popping that next lock!\n\n\nA Better Looking Lock:\nForzaFire said, \"I love this game so much but during my play time I noticed that the lock is very pixelated on my eyes.\"\n\nIn the last update we made the lock bigger but it added some pixelation like you said. Thanks for noticing and letting us know. It's a small detail, but those are the big things that matter to us when your playing a game for a long time. We got you! The lock is now updated. All fresh, new, and crispy.\n\n\nTutorial:\nsrloo17 said, \"To The Developers: you might want to think about adding some directions or a tutorial.\"\n\nTo srloo 17: We added the word \"tap\" to the first level. We're hoping that addresses the new players that need a little help. If that's not enough, we added a \"How to play\" button in the new settings menu! How cool, and if you tap it you'll see that one of our reviewers made it into the game. So thank you srloo, thank you Swarkles for your awesome review telling people how to play, and thank you to all our other reviews who shared the same feedback.\n\n\nLevel Select:\n-=Kri5=- said, \"It would be cool if there was a menu screen that you could go to any previous level. I wanted to show someone the game, but they had to start on my level 25 which was difficult for them.\"\n\nYou want to go back to old levels and play them?! Ummm, ok yeah!!! So we put a level select in the menu. We did our part, now you must go and show this game to EVERYONE.\n\n\nAds:\nOk, so there isn't a review for this, but as you all know, we tried ads during the first few days and it was horrible so we removed them. This past week we designed, what we think, is a fair setup for ads.\n\nFirst, we added in ads that show up after winning every 2 locks. This way it's not distracting your game while you're playing.\n\nNow for the second part. We added the option to watch a video every now and then when you lose on a lock, and if you watch the video, you'll get another shot to keep going to beat the lock where you lost.\n\nThis way, if you're really close to beating a lock but just need an extra boost, you can get it. For those purists out there who don't want an advantage, no prob, you can opt out, and beat it the old fashion way, with blood, sweat, and tears ... ok, actually, if that's how you're beating levels you should consult a doctor, lol.\n\nWe're here to hear feedback, if you're not thrilled with the ad placement, if you think it's too much, or if you have new ideas, we're all ears. We're learning from you to make a better game!\n\n\nThanks again everybody for helping our small studio dream big!\n\nKeep the reviews rolling in and #PopTheLock\n\nLove,\nTeam Simple Machine\n@simplemgames","trackId":979100082,"trackName":"Pop the Lock","primaryGenreName":"Games","primaryGenreId":6014,"isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true,"formattedPrice":"Free","minimumOsVersion":"6.0","averageUserRating":4.5,"userRatingCount":17591},{"screenshotUrls":["http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/ca/11/f5/ca11f586-7228-e031-5a39-cd05a0f0ac2f/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/45/13/d6/4513d6c5-6f51-8e5d-3cfd-03bac75a0ea6/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/b9/d0/08/b9d00888-3761-30a2-35a6-bbfff5204988/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple5/v4/5f/46/03/5f460312-5ba0-446d-6c5e-2f2de2f62881/screen320x320.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6d/89/00/6d8900a3-7fa6-c801-7ff0-9548d4ae08af/screen320x320.jpeg"],"ipadScreenshotUrls":["http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/3c/4e/de/3c4ede7a-5c97-c67d-358f-447f60b20952/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a2.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/98/ba/d6/98bad6d9-2ecd-5e0e-d1b0-003066010630/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/b8/86/4a/b8864a3d-5b8a-5c0b-0ccf-298f9b2c51ed/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a4.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple69/v4/6f/7f/0e/6f7f0e7b-9511-4d47-6264-89efccb821bc/screen480x480.jpeg","http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/ed/0c/cc/ed0cccd3-bf36-309f-35f0-e72c429571f4/screen480x480.jpeg"],"artworkUrl60":"http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple3/v4/26/cf/86/26cf868d-eda6-487c-9879-9ee0d917bf33/AppIcon57x57.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","artworkUrl512":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/ce/b5/28/ceb52875-39b5-8211-f010-6bbda2d63671/pr_source.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","artistViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/pocket-gems-inc./id335932431?uo=4","kind":"software","features":["gameCenter","iosUniversal"],"supportedDevices":["iPhone-3GS","iPhone4","iPodTouchFourthGen","iPad2Wifi","iPad23G","iPhone4S","iPadThirdGen","iPadThirdGen4G","iPhone5","iPodTouchFifthGen","iPadFourthGen","iPadFourthGen4G","iPadMini","iPadMini4G","iPhone5c","iPhone5s","iPhone6","iPhone6Plus","iPodTouchSixthGen"],"advisories":["Infrequent/Mild Mature/Suggestive Themes","Infrequent/Mild Cartoon or Fantasy Violence","Infrequent/Mild Realistic Violence","Infrequent/Mild Alcohol, Tobacco, or Drug Use or References"],"isGameCenterEnabled":true,"trackCensoredName":"Hidden Agendas: The Lionheart Mystery","userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":276,"languageCodesISO2A":["EN","FR","DE","IT","JA","KO","PT","ZH","ES"],"fileSizeBytes":"85577223","sellerUrl":"http://pocketgems.com/","contentAdvisoryRating":"12+","artworkUrl100":"http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple5/v4/ce/b5/28/ceb52875-39b5-8211-f010-6bbda2d63671/pr_source.png/0x0ss-85.jpg","averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4,"trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hidden-agendas-lionheart-mystery/id1013184171?mt=8&uo=4","trackContentRating":"12+","currency":"USD","wrapperType":"software","version":"1.11","artistId":335932431,"artistName":"Pocket Gems, Inc.","genres":["Games","Puzzle","Family","Entertainment"],"price":0,"description":"Travel the world in the time of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie, discovering clues and solving crimes in this new Hidden Object Game from Pocket Gems!\n\nKate St. Claire is an investigative reporter in the Victorian Era.

Designed in consultation with Leslie Scott, the original creator of Jenga®, Jenga for iPhone/iPod touch lets you take the tower building experience anywhere.\n\nSLASHGEAR\n\"Completely excellent! Hours of fun!\"\n\nPOCKETGAMER\n\"Pitch-perfect physics. Thoroughly enjoyable!\"\n\nTUAW\n\"Gorgeous graphics. VERY addictive. The only reason I stopped was my battery was drained!\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@NMGames)\nGet the latest news on our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/naturalmotiongames)\n________________________________________\n\nREALISTIC PHYSICS\nReal-time 3D physics simulation, authentically recreating the behavior of a real wooden Jenga tower. Each block is realistically affected by the surrounding blocks, recreating the same strategic depth as the original game.\n\nTOUCH CONTROL\nAnyone who’s played Jenga knows how delicate your touch needs to be. The iPhone’s super-accurate touch screen gives you the control you’ll need to go for world record heights (incidentally… the record is 40 2/3 layers!). Blocks can be teased out using a mix of gentle tapping and drag controls. It’s easy to begin with, but you’ll soon find it tough when the pressure is on and the tower is wobbling!\n\nGYROSCOPE INTEGRATION\nView the tower just as you would in real life by moving the device around it. The built-in gyroscopic mechanisms allow for unprecedented control of your viewpoint. Study the structure of the blocks to plan your next move.\n\nSOCIAL GAMEPLAY\nObviously the best part of Jenga is putting off your friends as they are making their move. The four-player Pass’n’Play mode truly reproduces the nail-biting tension of the real thing… but you can play it anywhere!\nAnd what’s more, Jenga for iPhone lets you compare your current tower height against that of friends around the world – while you play! A little friendly competition is the best motivator...\n\nARCADE MODE\nJenga on iPhone introduces a brand new mode: Jenga Arcade. Match colors for extra points and score multipliers by moving fast – but don’t topple the tower! While you play, you earn coins which you can spend on special boosts like collapse reverse, multipliers, and wildcards. It’s fast and frantic… totally turning Jenga on its head.\n\nSTUNNING VISUALS\nJenga for iPhone is beautiful. With full Retina display support, you won’t see a single pixel. Advanced wood shaders make the tower pop out and let you gauge its stability. And everything is set in beautiful environments, rivalling the quality of modern games consoles.\n\nGAME CENTER INTEGRATION\nLike all titles from NaturalMotion Games, Jenga fully supports Apple’s Game Center including leaderboards, achievements and easy friend comparisons.\n\nAUTHENTICITY\nDesigned in consultation with Leslie Scott, the inventor of Jenga, to create the most authentic Jenga experience ever.\n________________________________________\n\n** DON’T MISS OUR OTHER GAMES!!

Angry Birds 2 starts a new era of addictive slingshot gameplay with stunning graphics, challenging multi-stage levels, scheming boss pigs and even more destruction.\n \n**Angry Birds 2 is optimized for iPhone 5, iPad 3, iPad mini 2 and iPod Touch 5G or newer. You can try it on older devices, but we can't guarantee a smooth bird flinging experience!\n \nCHOOSE YOUR BIRD!\nIt’s the ultimate slingshot action strategy – YOU choose which bird to fling next! “But that makes it easier, right?” WRONG! You’ll need to choose wisely if you’re going to stop those eggs from getting scrambled. Plus, crush those pigs and blocks to fill up the Destruct-O-Meter and earn extra birds!\n\nNEW MULTI-STAGE LEVELS!\nYou’ve never seen Piggy Island like this – jaw-droppingly stunning levels brimming with exotic plants, quirky details, fun animations and plenty of peril. Those naughty porkies are now experts at building physics defying towers: levels now have multiple stages for an added challenge. Uh oh.\n\nSPECTACULAR SPELLS!\nBlizzards, Hot Chilis, Golden Ducks and other outrageous spells give you an added advantage against those swindling swine. And when you need some serious help, guess who’s at hand to make a pork-smashing cameo? That’s right, it’s the sardine loving Mighty Eagle. Oh yeah!\n\nCHALLENGE OTHER PLAYERS!\nChallenge players from across the world in the Arena to see who’s the best bird flinger of them all! Connect to Facebook and play new tournaments every day to earn feathers and level-up your flock. In the Arena you play until you run out of birds and spells, so get out there and solve the puzzles – you’re only up against the rest of the planet.\n \nDEFEAT BOSS PIGGIES!\nThere’s some serious bad guys on Piggy Island, and your slingshot skills are needed to take them down. Foreman Pig, Chef Pig and the infamous King Pig will stop at nothing to keep your eggs. Are you gonna let ‘em get away with that? It’s time to hit that pork and teach ‘em a lesson.\n \n-----------------------------\nFollow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/angrybirds\nhttps://twitter.com/AngryBirds\n-----------------------------\n \nAngry Birds 2 is completely free to play, but there are optional in-app purchases available.
